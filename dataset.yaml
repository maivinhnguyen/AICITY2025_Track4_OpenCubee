# Dataset configuration for Fisheye8k VIP Cup Night

# Path to the root directory of your dataset.
# All other paths (train, val, test) will be relative to this 'path' if they are not absolute.
# Using an absolute path here is often safest to avoid ambiguity.
# IMPORTANT: Use forward slashes (/) in paths for YAML, even on Windows, or double backslashes (\\).
path: /kaggle/input/fisheye8k-visdrone-vipcupnight2k-grayscalyololabel/fisheye8K_visdrone_vipcupnight2k_grayscale  # Root directory of your dataset

# Train/val/test sets as paths to directories containing image files
# The corresponding label files (.txt) should be in a parallel 'labels' directory
# e.g., if train images are in 'path/train/images', labels should be in 'path/train/labels'
train: train/images  # Relative to 'path' -> E:/fisheye8k-vipcupnight-newlabeled/train/images
val: val/images    # Relative to 'path' -> E:/fisheye8k-vipcupnight-newlabeled/val/images
# test: test/images # Optional: path to test images (if you have a separate test set)
